      If the confirmation email did not arrive it may be being classified as spam.
      Check your spam folder or try adding 'tiddlyhost@gmail.com' to your email
      contacts and then use
      =link_to 'this form', new_confirmation_path(:user)
      to resend the email.

      If you're still unable to receive the confirmation link,
      =mail_to Settings.support_email, 'email me', subject: "Tiddlyhost signup problems",
        body: "I signed up and I didn't receive my confirmation email.\n\nPlease send it to me manually if you can."
      and I'll see if I can send it to you directly.
